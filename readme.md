#Weather

My version of the weather application for the excellent [udemy react redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux).

The twist here is it's been done in `typescript` to give some type safety.

`Typescript` works suprisingly well with react and is unique in that it give you type safety and safe refactoring on your views as well.

To install setup execute `npm install` and to run execute `npm start`
